DumpSaves = F        ; Specify whether or not we should dump the CPak/TPak (and Gameboy) Save from the N64 Save File. Gets dumped to [OutputSavePath]

; If we are not dumping saves, specify the path for all TPaks, including any GB/GameBoy save files.
; If you are not using one, remove ALL text after the "=", like I did for TPak4 below.
; If you are using ANY CPaks, all of these fields must be blank.
; If the bytes are already in the correct format + don't need to be endian-flipped, add a * to the very beginning of your path like I did for TPak3.
;    ^^^^If you do not understand what this means, you likely don't need to add the *: Gameboy .savs always

; In port order, specify the path for all your CPaks.

;    ^^^^If you do not understand what this means, you likely don't need to flip them: .mpk files do not need the *
; Please remember to convert any of your CPak saves (e.g. DexDrive format) to the proper .mpk format prior to injection.
;       I recommend this web-based tool to do the conversion: https://savefileconverter.com/#/n64/dexdrive   (Make sure "Controller Pak" is highlighted when downloading the save.)
